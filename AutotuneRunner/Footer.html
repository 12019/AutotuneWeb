            Suggestions higlighted in yellow indicate a suggested change of at least 10%, and red indicates a change of +20% or
            -30% (the standard limits imposed by Autotune). Please always take care when adopting any changes suggested by
            Autotune, but especially for these larger highlighted changes.

            The green &amp; red blocks next to each basal suggestion indicate how many days the Autotune algorithm used
            actual BG data to produce the suggestion (green) and how many days it averaged the surrounding hours due to
            the data for that hour being dominated by other factors such as carb absorption. This is currently an experimental
            new feature to try to give an indication of how much trust to place in each suggestion.
